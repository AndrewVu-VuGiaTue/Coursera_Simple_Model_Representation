# Coursera_Simple_Model_Representation
This is the simple Linear Regression Model on Coursera that I learnt, and I want to make some new adjustments to it.

-The model is just for beginner, with only simple linear regression, no Gradient Descent, no Cost Function, no Training. Just for reference.

-The original model is from "https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction", course 1 - week 1.

-However, I finally made up my mind to add a version of model, which is called 'Model_Sample_1_cleaned_with_cost_function_gradient_descent'. This model is linear regression, but it now uses Gradient Descent and Cost Function (they are part of Machine Learning), which help to improve accuracy remarkably.

-One more important note is that all the data that I worked in this repository had just one feature, which is much easier for beginners to visualize and use the code.
